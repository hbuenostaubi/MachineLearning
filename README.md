### Knn and Baseline Model (with gradient descent):

# Algo 2
The project contains 3 machine learning implementations of on either the Yelp or Movie data set. For one of the  models, we incorporated [K-Nearest Neighbors](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/K-nearest_neighbors_algorithm#:~:text=In%20k%2DNN%20classification%2C%20the,positive%20integer%2C%20typically%20small).) to create a user and item based similarity model. Amazon or Target are infomously great at these algorithms, as they can predict what you may need when making a purchase at their stores. 

# Algo 3
Additionally, we created a [Baseline Model](https://towardsdatascience.com/how-to-build-a-baseline-model-be6ce42389fc) to predict the score of a movie or business based off user scores. This Baseline Model was based derived as different sets of average cuts on the data. Alone, the baseline model contain a large amount of error; as a result, we implemented [Gradient Descent] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gradient_descent) to lower the Mean Squared Error and predict a more accurate rating.
